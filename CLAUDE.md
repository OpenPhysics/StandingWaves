# CLAUDE.md — Standing Waves

## Project

Longitudinal standing waves in a pipe, in four screens: **Reflection**, **Phase**,
**Standing Waves**, **Instruments**.

Everything on screen follows from two definitions (`u = ∂ξ/∂t`, `p = −ρc²∂ξ/∂x`) and two boundary
conditions (closed: ξ = 0; open: p = 0). Nothing about the harmonic series is entered as data.

Read [`doc/model.md`](doc/model.md) before changing any physics and
[`doc/implementation-notes.md`](doc/implementation-notes.md) before changing the view layer. Both are
current and specific; neither is a stub.

## The three abstractions to understand first

| File | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `src/common/model/acoustics.ts` | The **single source of the sign conventions**. Every screen goes through it, so a sign slip cannot affect one screen and not another. |
| `src/common/model/PipeTermination.ts` | The three end *pairs* and every consequence — fₕ, kₕ, which harmonics exist. Modes are indexed by **the pipe's own fundamental**, so a stopped pipe simply has no mode at even h. That is what makes "odd harmonics only" expressible. |
| `src/common/model/PipeModalModel.ts` | The air column as one driven damped oscillator **per mode**. Shared by Standing Waves and Instruments. |

## Things that will bite you

- **Do not lay out the pipe and its trace strips with a `VBox`.** Both put model x = 0 at their own
  local x = 0, but their *bounds* start in different places (a closed end's cap juts to negative x, a
  tick label straddles the origin, a rotated axis title reaches left of its plot). Aligning bounds
  slides the traces out of register with the pipe — and by a different amount when the termination
  changes. Position by `.x`/`.y` against a shared origin.
- **Do not scale `c` or `fₕ` to slow the animation down.** Slow motion is applied to the *clock*, per
  screen (`REFLECTION_TIME_SCALE`, `HARMONIC_TIME_SCALE`). Every frequency in the model is a true SI
  value and the readouts say so.
- **The two integrators are different on purpose.** The lattice is conservative and needs a symplectic
  method (velocity Verlet); the modal bank is damped and driven and needs accuracy over thousands of
  cycles (RK4). Don't unify them.
- **On resonance a mode lags the drive by π/2.** Straight after `settleToSteadyState()` (Θ = 0) the
  resonant mode is at its *zero crossing*, and a snapshot of the pipe is dominated by the small
  off-resonant modes. Any shape assertion must first advance to the mode's extremum — see
  `settleAtPeak()` in `tests/PipeModalModel.test.ts`. Two tests failed this way before that helper.
- **Pressure needs its own trace scale**, not a multiple of the displacement scale: p carries a factor
  of kₕ, so resonant pressure falls as 1/h while resonant displacement falls as 1/h². Hence
  `resonantPressureAmplitude`.
- **Trace scales are the *resonant* amplitude, not the current peak.** Normalising to the instantaneous
  peak would make off-resonance, building-up and at-resonance all look identical and destroy the point
  of the frequency slider.
- **Drawn particle amplitudes are exaggerated** (`PARTICLE_AMPLITUDE_SPACINGS > 1`) because the eye
  reads the *gradient*, not the displacement. The system is linear; this touches no physics.

## Colour is a contract

`displacement = grey/black`, `velocity = red`, `pressure = blue` — on every screen, in every trace,
arrow and marker. This is Dan Russell's palette, where many learners first meet these curves.

Russell's own mass-spring page uses a different pair of colours from his phase pages; the sim
deliberately does **not** reproduce that, because a palette that changes between screens teaches that
colour carries no meaning. Never colour one of the three quantities by anything else.

## Accessibility

The three required layers are wired: `accessibleName` on every control, a live
`ScreenSummaryContent` per screen, and an explicit `pdomOrder` wrapper Node.

Each screen's live paragraph states **the conclusion**, not just the state — which quantity flipped on
reflection, whether velocity and pressure are in phase, that a stopped pipe sounds an octave below an
open one of the same length. Those are read off aligned curves in an instant by a sighted user; a
description that only named the numbers would omit the lesson.

The node markers carry **both** names of each point (`ξ = 0, p max`) for the same reason: labelling a
node with one of its two names is what produces the misconception that a node is a place where nothing
is happening.

The reference marker on the Phase screen is draggable by pointer **and** by keyboard, via a
`KeyboardListener` on arrow keys rather than a `KeyboardDragListener` — that class works in `Vector2`
and the marker has a single scalar coordinate.

## Compliance carve-outs

None. Root `StandingWavesConstants.ts` / `*Colors.ts` / `*Namespace.ts`, standard screen layout and
full a11y wiring all pass Baton's compliance check as-is.

## Testing

114 vitest specs; `happy-dom`, template `tests/setup.ts`.

| Path | Covers |
|---|---|
| `tests/acoustics.test.ts` | sign conventions vs. an analytic plane wave; p = ±ρc·u both directions |
| `tests/PipeTermination.test.ts` | c/2L, c/4L, the exact 2:1 octave, the odd series |
| `tests/modeShapes.test.ts` | boundary conditions, ψ = −(1/k)dφ/dx numerically, the quarter-wave offset |
| `tests/SpringChainModel.test.ts` | energy conservation, wave speed, **the reflection signs**, free-end convergence |
| `tests/PipeModalModel.test.ts` | Lorentzian, half-power points, τ = Q/(πfₕ), ring-down, odd-only enforcement |
| `tests/instrumentPresets.test.ts` | the flute/clarinet octave and their harmonic sets |
| `tests/memory-leak.test.ts` | model collection after dispose; view nodes releasing linked Properties |

Two habits to keep:

- **Anchor assertions to published or textbook values**, never to the implementation's own output, so
  a wrong constant fails instead of being locked in.
- **Assert view-node leaks by listener count against a baseline**, not `hasListeners()`.
  `PipeModalModel` puts its own `DerivedProperty`s on its geometry Properties, so those always carry
  listeners and `hasListeners()` can never fall to false however clean the node is.

## Commands

```bash
npm run lint && npm run check && npm run build && npm test
```

Use `?screens=1` … `?screens=4` to open one screen directly — much faster than clicking through the
home screen. `?showVelocityTrace=true` adds the velocity curve where it is optional.
