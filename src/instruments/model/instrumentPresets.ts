 *
 * Four pipes a learner can recognise, each described by nothing more than a length
 * and a termination.
 *
 * ── The comparison the screen is built around ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The flute and the clarinet are given the **same bore length** on purpose. That
 * one choice carries the whole lesson:
 *
 *   flute     — open at both ends   → f₁ = c/2L, every harmonic
 *   clarinet  — stopped at the reed → f₁ = c/4L, odd harmonics only
 *
 * so the clarinet sounds an **octave below** a flute of its own length, and its
 * ladder has gaps where the flute's has rungs. Both facts fall out of
 * `PipeTermination`; nothing here encodes them separately.
 *
 * ── What is a simplification, and said so ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A real clarinet is not a cylinder with a rigid cap, a real flute has an embouchure
 * hole rather than a plain open end, and both have end corrections that flatten the
 * ideal frequencies by a few percent. What survives that simplification — which
 * harmonics a pipe supports, and where its fundamental sits — is exactly what this
 * screen is about, and it survives intact. See doc/model.md.
