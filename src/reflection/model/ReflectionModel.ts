/**
 * ReflectionModel.ts
 *
 * The Reflection screen: a pulse launched down a pipe whose far end is either
 * rigid or open.
 *
 * ── Two chains, always ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The model holds **both** a closed-ended and an open-ended chain at all times,
 * launches them together, and steps them from the same clock. The "compare both
 * ends" checkbox only decides whether the second one is drawn.
 *
 * That is deliberate. The comparison is the pedagogy — Russell's side-by-side
 * panel — and it is only honest if the two chains are at the same instant of the
 * same pulse. Keeping both alive makes that true by construction rather than by
 * remembering to re-sync them, and switching the far end becomes a change of
 * which chain is visible rather than a rebuild that would discard the pulse.
