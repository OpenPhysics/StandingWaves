 *
 * A chain of point masses joined by springs — the mechanical analog of an air
 * column, and the model behind the Reflection screen.
 *
 * ── Why a lattice and not a formula ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The screen's whole claim is that a pulse *inverts* on reflection from a rigid
 * end and *does not* from a free one. Drawing that with an image-source formula
 * would be circular: the sign the screen is meant to demonstrate would be the
 * sign we typed in. Here nothing is special-cased at either end. Each mass obeys
 * the same law,
 *
 *   m·ξ̈ᵢ = k·(ξᵢ₊₁ − 2ξᵢ + ξᵢ₋₁)
 *
 * and an end differs only in which neighbours it has:
 *
 *   **closed** (rigid)  the end mass is pinned:  ξ = 0
 *   **open**   (free)   the end mass has no spring beyond it, so it feels only
 *                       m·ξ̈ = k·(ξ_{N−2} − ξ_{N−1}) — which is the discrete form
 *                       of ∂ξ/∂x = 0, i.e. p = 0
 *
 * The inversion then *emerges*. It is a consequence of the boundary condition,
 * which is exactly the thing being taught.
 *
 * ── Integrator ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Velocity Verlet, sub-stepped. This lattice is undamped and conservative, and a
 * pulse is watched over many round trips; a Runge-Kutta method would bleed
 * amplitude visibly over that span, while Verlet is symplectic and holds the
 * energy to a bounded oscillation. The explicit stability limit is
 * dt < 2/ω_max = √(m/k), and {@link CHAIN_STABILITY_SAFETY} keeps the actual
 * sub-step below a fraction of it.
 *
 * ── Discreteness, honestly ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A lattice is dispersive: ω = 2√(k/m)·|sin(qa/2)| rather than the continuum
 * ω = cq, so short-wavelength components travel slower than long ones and a
 * pulse slowly spreads. That is a property of the model, not a bug, and it is why
 * the launched pulse is several cells wide — see doc/model.md.
 *
 * ── Units ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * SI throughout. The lattice is calibrated to the medium: given the pipe length L
 * and the mass count N, the spacing is a = L/(N−1) and the stiffness ratio is set
 * by k/m = (c/a)², so the chain carries waves at the real speed of sound.
