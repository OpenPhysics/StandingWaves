/**
 * PipeNode.ts
 *
 * The pipe itself: two walls enclosing a bore, with each end drawn either capped
 * (closed) or open.
 *
 * The end treatment is the only picture a learner has of the boundary condition,
 * so it does real work. A **closed** end gets a heavy cap flush across the bore —
 * it has to read as immovable, because "rigid" is the entire content of ξ = 0. An
 * **open** end gets no cap and its walls stop short with a soft flare, so the bore
 * visibly continues into the room, which is what p = 0 means.
 *
 * Local origin (0, 0) is the left end of the bore *centreline*, so a caller can
 * place particles and curves in the same coordinates it uses for the pipe.
