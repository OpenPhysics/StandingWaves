/**
 * ParticleRowNode.ts
 *
 * A row of air-particle markers along the pipe axis, each displaced
 * **horizontally** from its equilibrium position.
 *
 * Horizontal is the whole point and the reason this is not a wave drawn as a
 * transverse squiggle: sound in a pipe is longitudinal, and the compressions a
 * learner is being asked to see are places where these markers crowd together.
 * The traces below the pipe are the abstraction; this is the thing itself.
 *
 * A `CanvasNode` rather than a row of `Circle`s: 48–80 markers repositioned every
 * frame is exactly the case where scenery's per-node bookkeeping costs more than
 * painting. Follows `RadioWaves/src/radio-waves/view/FieldLatticeNode.ts`.
