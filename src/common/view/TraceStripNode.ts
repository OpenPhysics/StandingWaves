/**
 * TraceStripNode.ts
 *
 * One or more curves of a quantity against **position along the pipe**, sharing a
 * single x axis and a single vertical scale each.
 *
 * ── Why this and not ACPhasor's WaveformNode ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `ACPhasor/src/common/view/WaveformNode.ts` is the fleet's multi-trace scope and
 * was the obvious candidate, but its traces are *analytic sinusoids* —
 * `setTrace(index, amplitude, ω, φ)`. Two of this sim's four screens plot things
 * that are not sinusoids: a dispersing pulse on a lattice, and a sum of a dozen
 * modes with independent amplitudes. So traces here are supplied as a sampling
 * callback, and the same node then serves every screen.
 *
 * It keeps WaveformNode's rules that matter, though:
 *
 *   - **the footprint is frozen at construction**, so a growing amplitude can
 *     never move this node or anything laid out below it;
 *   - **each trace has its own full scale**, so displacement in metres and
 *     pressure in pascals can share one x axis. Sharing the x axis is the whole
 *     point: the quarter-wave offset between two quantities is then a
 *     *horizontal* offset a learner can point at;
 *   - **each caption is drawn in its own trace colour**, so no separate legend is
 *     needed.
 *
 * Sampling is done in a `CanvasNode`: at 240 samples × up to three traces, every
 * frame, allocating Vector2s and rebuilding bamboo plots would dominate the frame.
