/**
 * PipeTermination.ts
 *
 * How the two ends of the pipe are terminated, and everything that follows from
 * it: which harmonics exist, what their frequencies are, and where the
 * displacement and pressure nodes sit.
 *
 * ── The two boundary conditions ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A **closed** (rigid) end cannot move, so ξ = 0 there: it is a displacement
 * node and — because the gradient is largest where the displacement is pinned —
 * a pressure antinode.
 *
 * An **open** end is held at atmospheric pressure by the room outside, so p = 0
 * there: a pressure node and a displacement antinode.
 *
 * The two are exact opposites, which is why a reflected wave inverts in one
 * quantity and not in the other. That asymmetry is the whole sim.
 *
 * ── Why a *pair* and not a per-end flag ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The mode series depends on the combination, not on either end alone:
 *
 *   matching ends    (closed–closed, open–open)   f₁ = c/2L,   harmonics 1,2,3,4,…
 *   mismatched ends  (closed–open)                f₁ = c/4L,   harmonics 1,3,5,7,…
 *
 * Both facts about the stopped pipe come out of that one line: its fundamental
 * is an **octave below** an open pipe of the same length, and it sounds **only
 * the odd harmonics** of that fundamental. Naming the pair keeps the dependence
 * visible. (WaveComposer's `PipeBoundary` calls the mismatched case
 * `CLOSED_PIPE`, the musician's name for it; here, where all three combinations
 * are selectable, that name would be ambiguous.)
 *
 * ── Numbering convention ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything below indexes modes by **harmonic number h relative to that pipe's
 * own fundamental**, so h is always an integer and fₕ = h·f₁. A stopped pipe
 * simply has no mode at even h — which is what {@link isModeAllowed} reports and
 * what the overtone ladder greys out.
