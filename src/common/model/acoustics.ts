 * The sim's sign conventions, in one place. Every screen reduces to the same
 * three quantities and the same two definitions, so they live here rather than
 * being re-derived per screen — a sign slip in one screen and not another is
 * exactly the bug this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * ── The three quantities ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   ξ(x, t)   particle displacement along the pipe axis   (m)
 *   u(x, t)   particle velocity      u = ∂ξ/∂t            (m/s)
 *   p(x, t)   acoustic (gauge) pressure                   (Pa)
 *
 * ── The two definitions ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   u = ∂ξ/∂t
 *   p = −ρc² ∂ξ/∂x
 *
 * The minus sign in p is the whole convention: where the air is squeezed
 * together the displacement gradient is negative (particles behind are moving
 * forward faster than those ahead), so a compression is a *positive* pressure.
 *
 * ── The consequence worth knowing ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * For a plane wave travelling in the ±x direction the two are proportional:
 *
 *   p = ± ρc · u
 *
 * with ρc the characteristic impedance. So in a forward-going wave the velocity
 * and pressure are **in phase** — the air moves fastest in the +x direction
 * exactly where it is most compressed — and in a backward-going wave they are
 * **180° out of phase**. That single sign is the content of the Phase screen.
