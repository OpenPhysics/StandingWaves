 *
 * The spatial shape of one standing-wave mode, in displacement and in pressure.
 *
 * ── The point of this file ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A mode of the pipe is a product of a shape in space and an oscillation in
 * time:
 *
 *   ξ(x, t) = A · φₕ(x) · cos(ωₕ t)
 *
 * and the pressure follows from p = −ρc² ∂ξ/∂x, so it carries the *derivative*
 * of the same shape:
 *
 *   p(x, t) = ρc²Akₕ · ψₕ(x) · cos(ωₕ t),      ψₕ = −(1/kₕ) dφₕ/dx
 *
 * Differentiating a sine gives a cosine. That is the entire reason a pressure
 * antinode sits at a displacement node: the two shapes are a **quarter
 * wavelength apart in space**, always, in every mode of every termination. Note
 * also that they share the same `cos(ωₕt)` — displacement and pressure are in
 * phase in *time* and offset in *space*, which is the opposite of the travelling
 * wave on the Phase screen, where they are offset in time and aligned in space.
 *
 * Both shapes are returned normalised to a peak of 1, so a caller scales them by
 * whatever amplitude it is drawing at.
 *
 * ── Per termination ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   closed–closed   φ = sin(kx)   ψ = −cos(kx)    ξ pinned at both ends
 *   open–open       φ = cos(kx)   ψ = +sin(kx)    p pinned at both ends
 *   closed–open     φ = sin(kx)   ψ = −cos(kx)    ξ pinned at x=0, p at x=L
 *
 * Closed–open shares its formulas with closed–closed; only kₕ differs (odd
 * quarter wavelengths rather than whole half wavelengths), and that alone is
 * what turns the antinode at x = L from a node.
