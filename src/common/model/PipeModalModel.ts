/**
 * PipeModalModel.ts
 *
 * The air column in a finite pipe, driven at one end, as a bank of independent
 * damped driven oscillators — one per mode. Shared by the Standing Waves and
 * Instruments screens.
 *
 * ── Why a modal bank rather than "add two travelling waves" ───────────────────
 *
 * Summing a forward and a backward wave of equal amplitude gives a perfect
 * standing wave at any frequency you like, which is precisely the thing that is
 * not true of a real pipe. A pipe responds *selectively*: drive it off resonance
 * and almost nothing happens; drive it near a mode and the pattern grows over
 * several cycles until damping balances the drive.
 *
 * So each mode h carries its own amplitude aₕ(t) obeying
 *
 *   äₕ + (ωₕ/Q)·ȧₕ + ωₕ²·aₕ = F·cos(Θ)
 *
 * and the state of the pipe is the sum of the mode shapes weighted by those
 * amplitudes:
 *
 *   ξ(x, t) = Σ aₕ(t)·φₕ(x)          p(x, t) = Σ ρc²kₕ·aₕ(t)·ψₕ(x)
 *
 * Two things then come out for free rather than being animated by hand:
 *
 *   - the **steady-state amplitude is a Lorentzian** in the drive frequency, so
 *     resonance is something you can hunt for with the frequency slider;
 *   - the **build-up takes the right time**, τ = 2Q/ωₕ = Q/(πfₕ), so switching to
 *     an exact harmonic visibly fills the pipe over a few seconds.
 *
 * ── Drive coupling ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The driver sits at the **left** end and is whatever kind of source that end
 * admits: a pressure source (a reed) against a closed end, a volume-velocity
 * source (a jet) at an open end. Each couples to the quantity its end has an
 * antinode in — pressure at a closed end, displacement at an open one — so in
 * both cases the coupling to every mode has unit magnitude. That is not a
 * convenience: it is why a reed at the stopped end of a clarinet can excite the
 * whole odd-harmonic ladder.
 *
 * ── Units ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything here is SI and real: metres, seconds, hertz, pascals. Model time
 * runs slower than wall-clock time (see HARMONIC_TIME_SCALE) but it is still
 * seconds, so `step` takes model seconds and every frequency is a true one.
