# Model — Standing Waves

This document describes the physics for an educator. Its companion,
[implementation-notes.md](./implementation-notes.md), targets developers.

## Overview

The simulation is about **longitudinal** waves in a column of air, and specifically about three
things that a picture of "sound as a wiggly line" hides:

1. **Displacement, velocity and pressure are three different quantities** that peak in different
   places and at different times. Air moving fastest is not air most compressed — except in a
   forward-travelling wave, where it is; reverse the wave and the relationship inverts.
2. **An open pipe end and a closed pipe end reflect a pulse differently**, and in exactly
   complementary ways: a closed end flips the displacement and preserves the pressure; an open end
   flips the pressure and preserves the displacement.
3. **In a standing wave, a pressure antinode sits where the displacement has a node.** This is the
   single most-missed idea in introductory acoustics, and it is what makes a stopped pipe sound an
   octave low with only odd harmonics.

Everything the sim shows follows from two definitions and two boundary conditions. Nothing about
the harmonic series is entered as data.

## Quantities and units

Every quantity in the model is a real SI value. There are no scaled or dimensionless stand-ins.

| Quantity | Symbol | Units | Range / value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Particle displacement | ξ | m | ~10⁻³ (derived) |
| Particle velocity | u = ∂ξ/∂t | m/s | derived |
| Acoustic (gauge) pressure | p | Pa | derived |
| Position along pipe | x | m | 0 … L |
| Pipe length | L | m | 0.20 – 1.00 (default 0.50) |
| Speed of sound | c | m/s | 343 (fixed) |
| Air density | ρ | kg/m³ | 1.204 (fixed) |
| Characteristic impedance | ρc | Pa·s/m | 413 |
| Bulk modulus | ρc² | Pa | 1.42 × 10⁵ |
| Drive frequency | f | Hz | ~85 – 2800 |
| Mode quality factor | Q | — | 20 (fixed) |

`c` and `ρ` are held fixed deliberately. Making the sound speed adjustable would let a learner
change every frequency in the sim without changing anything they can see in the pipe.

## The two definitions

```
u = ∂ξ/∂t
p = −ρc² ∂ξ/∂x
```

The minus sign is the whole convention: where air is squeezed together the displacement gradient is
negative, so **a compression is a positive pressure**.

For a plane wave travelling in the ±x direction these combine into

```
p = ± ρc · u
```

so velocity and pressure are **in phase** in a forward-going wave and **180° out of phase** in a
backward-going one. That single sign is the content of the Phase screen.

## The two boundary conditions

| End | Physical constraint | Displacement | Pressure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Closed** (rigid) | cannot move: ξ = 0 | node — reflects **inverted** | antinode — reflects **upright** |
| **Open** | held at room pressure: p = 0 | antinode — reflects **upright** | node — reflects **inverted** |

They are exact opposites, which is why one quantity inverts on reflection and the other does not.

## The harmonic series

Because the mode series depends on the *combination* of ends, the sim names the pair rather than
each end separately:

| Termination | Displacement shape φₕ(x) | Pressure shape ψₕ(x) | f₁ | Harmonics |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Closed–Closed | sin(kₕx) | −cos(kₕx) | c/2L | 1, 2, 3, 4, … |
| Open–Open | cos(kₕx) | +sin(kₕx) | c/2L | 1, 2, 3, 4, … |
| Closed–Open | sin(kₕx) | −cos(kₕx) | c/4L | 1, 3, 5, 7, … |

with `fₕ = h·f₁` and `kₕ = 2πfₕ/c`, and ψₕ = −(1/kₕ)·dφₕ/dx.

Two consequences worth stating to a class:

- **A stopped pipe's fundamental is an octave below** an open pipe of the same length, which is why
  a stopped organ pipe can be built half as long as the note it sounds.
- **A stopped pipe sounds only the odd harmonics.** Closed–Open shares its *formulas* with
  Closed–Closed; only kₕ differs, and that alone deletes every even mode.

Note that ψₕ is the **derivative** of φₕ. Differentiating a sine gives a cosine, so the two shapes
are always a quarter wavelength apart in space — that is the whole reason a pressure antinode lands
on a displacement node. Note also that both carry the same cos(ωₕt): in a standing wave displacement
and pressure are in phase in *time* and offset in *space*, the exact opposite of the travelling wave
on the Phase screen.

## Screen by screen

### Reflection — a mass-spring chain

A chain of 80 point masses joined by springs, the mechanical analogue of an air column. Each mass
obeys the same law,

```
m·ξ̈ᵢ = k(ξᵢ₊₁ − 2ξᵢ + ξᵢ₋₁)
```

and an end differs only in which neighbours it has: a closed end is pinned (ξ = 0), an open end
simply has no spring beyond it, which is the discrete form of ∂ξ/∂x = 0. **The inversion is never
programmed in — it emerges.** That is why the screen integrates a lattice rather than drawing a
formula: with an image-source formula, the sign being demonstrated would be the sign we typed.

The chain is calibrated to the medium: with spacing a = L/(N−1), the stiffness ratio is set by
k/m = (c/a)², so the chain carries waves at the true speed of sound.

The launched pulse is a Gaussian in *displacement*, with velocities set to −c·∂ξ/∂x so that it
travels one way only. Its pressure signature is therefore the gradient of a Gaussian: a rarefaction
lobe and a compression lobe, compression leading. What reflection does to that ordering is the
comparison the screen draws.

**Known simplification — lattice dispersion.** A discrete chain is dispersive:
ω = 2√(k/m)·|sin(qa/2)| rather than the continuum ω = cq. Short-wavelength components therefore
travel slower than long ones and a pulse slowly spreads over many round trips. This is a real
property of the model, not a defect, and it is why the pulse is launched several lattice cells wide —
wide enough that the spreading stays below the line width over the couple of round trips the screen
is meant to show.

### Phase — a travelling wave in closed form

ξ(x,t) = A·cos(ωt ∓ kx), with u and p taken as exact analytic derivatives. No integration, no
reflections, no transients: the screen makes a claim about an *ideal* plane wave, and anything else
on screen would only muddy it.

### Standing Waves — a driven modal bank

Each mode h carries its own amplitude obeying

```
äₕ + (ωₕ/Q)·ȧₕ + ωₕ²·aₕ = F·cos(Θ)
```

and the pipe is the sum Σ aₕ(t)·φₕ(x). Summing two counter-propagating waves instead would produce a
perfect standing wave at *any* frequency, which is precisely the thing that is not true of a real
pipe. This way two behaviours come out for free rather than being animated by hand:

- the **steady-state response is a Lorentzian**, so resonance is something to hunt for;
- the **build-up takes the right time**, τ = 2Q/ωₕ = Q/(πfₕ) — about 3 s of wall clock at the
  default pipe.

Q = 20 is lower than a real organ pipe (30–50), chosen so the resonance is broad enough to find by
dragging a slider and the build-up is watchable rather than tens of seconds long.

The driver sits at the left end and is whatever kind of source that end admits: a pressure source (a
reed) against a closed end, a volume-velocity source (a jet) at an open one. Each couples to the
quantity its end has an antinode in, so both couple equally to every mode — which is *why* a reed at
the stopped end of a clarinet can excite the whole odd-harmonic ladder.

### Instruments — the same pipe, four ways

Four presets, each nothing more than a length and a termination. The flute and the clarinet are
deliberately given the **same bore length**, so that the octave and the missing harmonics are visibly
attributable to the termination alone.

Bar heights in the spectrum are the pipe's own resonant response under an equal-per-mode excitation,
which falls as 1/h². That rolloff is derived, not a timbre curve drawn to look plausible.

**Known simplifications.** A real clarinet is not a cylinder with a rigid cap, a real flute has an
embouchure hole rather than a plain open end, and both have end corrections that flatten the ideal
frequencies by a few percent. Neither the reed's nor the jet's own harmonic envelope is modelled. What
survives all of that — *which* harmonics a pipe supports and *where* its fundamental sits — is exactly
what the screen is about.

## Slow motion

Audible sound is far too fast to animate: the default pipe's 343 Hz fundamental has a 2.9 ms period,
and a pulse crosses the pipe in 1.5 ms. Both would alias into meaningless flicker.

So the **clock** is slowed and the physics is left alone. Every frequency, length and speed in the
model is a true SI value; each screen simply advances model time at a fraction of wall-clock time —
1/2000 on Reflection (a crossing takes ~3 s), 1/200 elsewhere (the fundamental oscillates at an
apparent 1.7 Hz). The readouts stay honest: the sim really does say 343 Hz.

## Where the numbers come from

Assertions in `tests/` are anchored to textbook and published values rather than to the
implementation, so a wrong constant fails instead of being locked in:

- c/2L and c/4L, and the exact 2:1 octave between them;
- the odd-harmonic series of a stopped pipe;
- ρc ≈ 413 rayl and ρc² ≈ 1.42 × 10⁵ Pa for air at 20 °C;
- the half-power points at fₕ(1 ± 1/2Q) and the build-up constant Q/(πfₕ);
- energy conservation and the measured wave speed on the lattice;
- and, most importantly, the reflection signs at each kind of end.
